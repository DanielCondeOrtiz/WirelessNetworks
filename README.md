# WirelessSensorNetworks
Project for Wireless Sensor Networks course in Universidad de Sevilla using TelosB sensors.

A moving sensor (Arduino + wheels) calles Master and some static sensors called Slaves and Anchors.
There are 4 anchors forming a big square in which master and slaves are placed. Master and slaves have to detect their position using anchors and an algorithm and wirelessly communicate. Master has to navigate to all the slaves.
